            Hello. I am a Web Developer with hands-on experience in building
            production-grade applications. In 2024, I joined Innovative
            Marketing Services as an intern, and worked there for a year.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am set to graduate this June with a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer
            Science from the Institute of Management Sciences, Peshawar.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interests span advanced frontend and backend development, AI
            engineering, and contributing to open-source communities. I
            primarily work with TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python.
          </p>
          <p>I live in Peshawar.</p>
